<details><summary><b>Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7`] and `k` of `17`, return`true` since `10 + 7 is 17`. </b></summary>
  
</details>

<details><summary><b>Given a string of letters, create a function to make a new string consisting of the number of times each letter appears, followed by the letter itself. For example, "aaabbccccd" would become "3a2b4c1d".  </b></summary>
  
</details>



<details><summary><b>Given an integer, create a function to check if it is a palindrome    </b></summary>
  
</details>



<details><summary><b>Given a list of words , group them by an anagram and print each group </b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Write an function to find of a number is prime</b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> What is good code and greate code </b></summary>

<details><summary><b> Explain cloud computing </b></summary>

<details><summary><b> Reverse name</b></summary>

> `def reverse(s): 
  str = "" 
  for i in s: 
    str = i + str
  return str `
  
</details>


<details><summary><b>Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

	` 1
	/   \
	2    3
	    / \
	   4   5
	`

</b></summary>

  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out: 
`
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
`

</b></summary>

</details>


<details><summary><b> You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given N, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. </b></summary>
  
</details>



<details><summary><b> Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it. 
`   *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
`
You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).
</b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

    shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
    restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
</b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.
`[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]`

 and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.
</b></summary>
  
</details>



<details><summary><b> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive element sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. </b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Given a number in the form of a list of digits, return all possible permutations.

For example, given [1,2,3], return [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]] </b></summary>
  
</details>


<details><summary><b> Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, implement readN(n) which reads n characters.

For example, given a file with the content “Hello world”, three read7() returns “Hello w”, “orld” and then “”. </b></summary>
  
</details>



<details><summary><b> Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15. </b></summary>
  
</details>

<details><summary><b> A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.

Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28. </b></summary>
